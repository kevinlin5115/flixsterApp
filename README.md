### Notes
The process of building the app went smoothly by following the detailed instruction videos. However, when I tried to push the project onto Github it showed that the version of the repo is too old so I tried pulling from github and re-push it again. When I do that, the original files I created (eg. GridCell, MovieDetailsViewController etc.) were gone.
